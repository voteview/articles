## How often did Joe Biden vote with Democrats?

Here I calculate the lifetime rate at which Joseph Biden sided with the plurality of his party when casting rollcall votes.  For comparison, I also calculate the lifetime rate of party loyalty for all other Democratic senators with whom Biden served over this time in the Congress.   

## Reading the data

I begin by reading in the necessary data.

```{r message=F, warning=F}
rollcalls <- read_csv("https://voteview.com/static/data/out/rollcalls/Sall_rollcalls.csv") %>% filter(congress>60)
members <- read_csv("https://voteview.com/static/data/out/members/Sall_members.csv") %>% filter(congress>60)
votes <- read_csv("https://voteview.com/static/data/out/votes/Sall_votes.csv") %>% filter(congress>60)
```

## Calculating pary loyalty

I then calculate the rate at which all Democratic senators vote with their party over the their entire careers.  Finally, I filter out just those Senators whose service in the Congress overlapped with Mr. Biden's.  A member is said to have voted with her party if she cast a vote that matched those of the plurality of the Democratic caucus.  Rollcalls on which the party was evenly divided are excluded.      

```{r}
map_vote <- c("y","y","y", "n", "n", "n", "nv", "nv", "nv")
all <- votes %>% 
          left_join(members, by = c("congress", "chamber", "icpsr")) %>%
          left_join(rollcalls, by=c("congress", "chamber", "rollnumber")) %>%
          filter(party_code == 100) %>%
          group_by(congress, rollnumber) %>%
          mutate(cast_code = map_vote[as.integer(cast_code)], 
                 party_yea = sum(cast_code=='y'), 
                 party_no = sum(cast_code=='n'),
                 party_cast_code = ifelse(party_yea > party_no, 'y', 'n'),
                 with_party = (party_cast_code == cast_code)) %>%
          filter(party_yea != party_no) %>%
          group_by(icpsr) %>%
          summarize(name = bioname[1],
                  state_abbrev = state_abbrev[1],
                  party_loyalty = sum(with_party)/sum(cast_code != 'nv'),
                  votes_cast = sum(cast_code != 'nv'),
                  min_congress = min(congress),
                  max_congress = max(congress)) %>%
          filter( max_congress >= 93, min_congress <= 111) %>%
          mutate(rank = rank(-party_loyalty)) %>%
          ungroup() %>%
          select(rank, everything(), -icpsr) %>%
          arrange(desc(party_loyalty))

write_csv(all, path="biden_party_loyalty.csv")
```

## Tabulating the results

Pulling out Mr. Biden, 
```{r}
biden <- all %>% filter(str_detect(name, "BIDEN"))
```
we find that he voted with the Democrats `r sprintf("%3.1f", 100*biden$party_loyalty)` percent of the time making him the `r ordinal(biden$rank)` most loyal of the `r NROW(all)` Democratic senators with whom he served. 

Here is a complete table:

```{r}
all %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names=c("Rank", "Member", "State", "Party loyalty", "Votes Cast", "First", "Last")) %>%
  row_spec(c(biden$rank), 
           bold = T, background = "#f6fcba") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                            font_size = 10, 
                            full_width = FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" "=5, "Congresses Served"=2))
```

This table can be download as spreadsheet [here](biden_party_loyalty.csv).
